			<h1>Whatever It Takes</h1>
			<p>
				Falling too fast to prepare for this<br>
				Tripping in the world could be dangerous<br>
				Everybody circling is vulturous,<br> 
				negative, nepotist<br>
				Everybody waiting for the fall of man<br>
				Everybody praying for the end of times<br>
				Everybody hoping they could be the one<br>
				I was born to run, I was born for this<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Whip, whip<br>
				Run me like a race horse<br>
				Pull me like a ripcord<br>
				Break me down and build me up<br>
				I wanna be the<br>
				Slip, slip<br>
				Word upon your lip, lip<br>
				Letter that you rip, rip<br>
				Break me down and build me up<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
				I do whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				Yeah, take me to the top, I’m ready for<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
				I do what it takes<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Always had a fear of being typical<br>
				Looking at my body feeling miserable<br>
				Always hanging on to the visual<br>
				I wanna be invisible<br>
				Looking at my years like a martyrdom<br>
				Everybody needs to be a part of them<br>
				Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son<br>
				I was born to run, I was born for this<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Whip, whip<br>
				Run me like a race horse<br>
				Pull me like a ripcord<br>
				Break me down and build me up<br>
				I wanna be the<br>
				Slip, slip<br>
				Word upon your lip, lip<br>
				Letter that you rip, rip<br>
				Break me down and build me up<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
				I do whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				Yeah, take me to the top I’m ready for<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				I do what it takes<br>	
			</p>
			<p>
				Hypocritical, egotistical<br>
				Don’t wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical<br>
				Working hard on something that I’m proud of<br>
				Out of the box, an epoxy to the world<br> 
				And the vision we’ve lost<br>
				I’m an apostrophe, I’m just a symbol<br> 
				To remind you that there’s more to see<br>
				I’m just a product of the system, a catastrophe<br>
				and yet a masterpiece and yet I’m half-diseased<br>
				and when I am deceased<br>
				At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily<br>
				and leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee<br>
				I do what it takes<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
				I do whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				Yeah take me to the top, I’m ready for<br>
				Whatever it takes<br>
				cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
				I do that it takes<br>
