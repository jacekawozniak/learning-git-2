        <h1>Whatever It Takes</h1>
        <p>
			Falling too fast to prepare for this
			Tripping in the world could be dangerous
			Everybody circling is vulturous, 
			negative, nepotist
			Everybody waiting for the fall of man
			Everybody praying for the end of times
			Everybody hoping they could be the one
			I was born to run, I was born for this

			Whip, whip
			Run me like a race horse
			Pull me like a ripcord
			Break me down and build me up
			I wanna be the
			Slip, slip
			Word upon your lip, lip
			Letter that you rip, rip
			Break me down and build me up

			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top, I’m ready for
			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do what it takes
		</p>
	    <p>
			Always had a fear of being typical
			Looking at my body feeling miserable
			Always hanging on to the visual
			I wanna be invisible
			Looking at my years like a martyrdom
			Everybody needs to be a part of them
			Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
			I was born to run, I was born for this

			Whip, whip
			Run me like a race horse
			Pull me like a ripcord
			Break me down and build me up
			I wanna be the
			Slip, slip
			Word upon your lip, lip
			Letter that you rip, rip
			Break me down and build me up

			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top I’m ready for
			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

			I do what it takes

			Hypocritical, egotistical
			Don’t wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
			Working hard on something that I’m proud of
			Out of the box, an epoxy to the world 
			And the vision we’ve lost
			I’m an apostrophe, I’m just a symbol 
			To remind you that there’s more to see
			I’m just a product of the system, a catastrophe
			and yet a masterpiece and yet I’m half-diseased
			and when I am deceased
			At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
			and leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
			I do what it takes

			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah take me to the top, I’m ready for
			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do that it takes
