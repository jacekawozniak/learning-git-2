        <h1>Whatever It Takes</h1>
        <p>
			Falling too fast to prepare for this
			Tripping in the world could be dangerous
			Everybody circling is vulturous, 
			negative, nepotist
			Everybody waiting for the fall of man
			Everybody praying for the end of times
			Everybody hoping they could be the one
			I was born to run, I was born for this

			Whip, whip
			Run me like a race horse
			Pull me like a ripcord
			Break me down and build me up
			I wanna be the
			Slip, slip
			Word upon your lip, lip
			Letter that you rip, rip
			Break me down and build me up

			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top, Iâ€™m ready for
			Whatever it takes
			cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do what it takes
